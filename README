Key principles of code style and design:

1.We implement layered structure to the application with good documentation. Files are nested in proper folders to make it easier to manage and maintain as the project grows.

2.We add sufficient but not tedious comments to the code which gives a clue to developers and others who read the code. The comments should not be overwhelming or impede reading the code.

3.We use component and module of Angular to organize difference components or features in the app. The process is to structure the skeleton of the app and then add on detailed components. This makes components reusable and the app scalable during the evolution of system.

4.We import libraries only where appropriate and necessary, and avoid leaving unused libraries which makes the document redundant.

5.We use CSS styling elegantly with a defined design standard, and the style is uniform and consistent across the application. 

API and database design principle:

6. API single responsibility principle. Every function and model should be responsible for a single part of the
functionality that to be completed.

7. API file high scalability principle. New API would be easy to added to exsiting files without any change. The whole
API would be easy to extend.

8. API high readability principle. Add comment to necessary functions and statement that maintainer could easily understand 
what thoses function means.

9. Backend file separation principle. Split files into different directory according to its functinality and feature, such as 
middle, router and model directory. 

10. Database ODM one to one principle. Every of mongodb collections should be ressponding to a single mongoose model. Inside that model,
limitation, validation and basic configuration should be required.
